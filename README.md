# promsclient.js

promsclient.js is a library of functions that helps JavaScript coders generate provenance reports using the PROV and PROMS Ontologies. It also has a function to send a Report to an instance of the PROMS Server tool (http://promsns.org/repo/proms-server) for storage.

The classes match the PROMS-O OWL classes, for example the function 'ReportingSystem' matches the PROMS-O 'ReportingSystem' class.

promsclient.js is expected to be extended so if you need so add to it to get your reporting job done, please do so! Please also consider sending us pull requests to incorporate your additions here.
